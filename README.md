For more information please refer to the [wiki] (https://github.com/att/XACML/wiki).

Building the source code
------------------------
The AT&T Laboratories development team uses Eclipse to build the software. Simply import each project into an Eclipse workspace. 

The project uses Java JDK 1.7, you will need to ensure Eclipse has that JDK installed in your development environment.

The project uses Apache Ivy to bring external dependencies into the build environment. You will need to install the Apache IvyDE Eclipse plug-in for this to occur.
