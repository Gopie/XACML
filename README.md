# Building the source code

The AT&T Laboratories development team uses Eclipse to build the software. Simply import each project into an Eclipse workspace.

# Requirements

*  Apache Ivy to bring external dependencies into the build environment. You will need to install the Apache IvyDE Eclipse plug-in for these dependencies to be resolved.
